# js-a-sketch
A poor man's MS Paint, created as an exercise in Javascript for The Odin Project.

It's nowhere near Paint, but calling it an Etch-A-Sketch feels weird.

Move your mouse pointer over any square to colour it, and move over it again to darken it! Passing 10 times over a square turns it black.
Create a new grid any time!

Things learned from this project:
* Using CSS Grid
* Basic interfacing of JS to HTML and CSS
* Laying out a page with JS
